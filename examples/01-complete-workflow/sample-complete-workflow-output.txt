  📦 Batch Results: output/pytorch-single-worker-distributed_2025-07-06_19-58-59/inference-results.txt

📈 Training Summary:
Test Accuracy: 12.00%

🔗 Next Steps:
  1. Review training logs: cat output/pytorch-single-worker-distributed_2025-07-06_19-58-59/master-pod-logs.txt
  2. Test with your images: python scripts/test_mnist_model.py --image your_image.png --model output/pytorch-single-worker-distributed_2025-07-06_19-58-59/trained-model.pth
  3. Try other examples: ls examples/
  4. Scale up training: edit configs/pytorch-distributed-job.yaml (increase workers)

✅ 🎉 Workflow results displayed!

🧹 Cleanup options:
  • Keep everything: Job running, model saved, ready for more inference
  • Clean job only: ./cleanup.sh (keeps model and cluster)
  • Clean everything: make cleanup-all (removes cluster too)

End of Sample Output
=================================

Notes:
------
- Total workflow time: ~3.5 minutes
- Model successfully trained and saved (185K file)
- All 10 synthetic test images processed
- Model appears to have low accuracy (12%) - likely due to synthetic data
- Pod logs show training completed successfully
- Volume mounts working correctly after fixes
- Debug features helped identify and resolve issues

What this shows:
- Infrastructure setup (Kind cluster + training operator)
- Distributed training with PyTorchJob
- Model artifact collection
- Synthetic image generation and testing
- Batch inference processing
- Complete end-to-end ML workflow

Key Success Indicators:
✅ PyTorchJob completed successfully
✅ Model moved from volume mount (185K)
✅ All synthetic images processed
✅ Batch inference completed
✅ Training artifacts saved properly
